# Python---French-flash-cards
Flash cards with French words and their English translation

1. After downloading all files, with your python IDE, run main.py.

2. A GUI will show up with the flash cards; they can be either a word in English or French.

3. If you know this word/translation, click on the green button, and the word will be eliminated of the words to learn.

4. If you still need to practice this word, click on the red button, and it will show up randomly in the future.

5. When all the available words have been memorised, you will receive a congratulatory message saying you are done!
